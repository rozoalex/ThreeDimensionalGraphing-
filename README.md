# ThreeDimensionalGraphing

The class ThreeDimensionalGraphing takes a function (e.g.  e^x+7y) of x and y and generates z, with specific ranges of x and y. All results are rounded to the closest integers. 
The default domain of x and y is [-10,10]X[-10,10]

The test.java class is the main method, an example of how to use the class ThreeDimensionalGraphing.

Use toString method can check the result of the calculation.

legal operations: +  -  *  /  ^  ()

legal parameters: x  y  e (euler number: 2.718281...)

log() ln() ! direv() are not included yet
